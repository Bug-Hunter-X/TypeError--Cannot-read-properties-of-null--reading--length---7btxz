# JavaScript TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')`.  This occurs when attempting to access the `length` property of a variable that is currently `null` or `undefined`. 

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected version.  Always check for null or undefined values before accessing object properties.
